LiveSession provides in-memory sessions for LiveViews and Phoenix controllers.

You can use them like regular Plug sessions in Phoenix controllers and have
full read/write access to session data from LiveViews - including updates
via Phoenix.PubSub.

## Installation
1. Add this project to your `mix.exs` as a dependency:
   `{:phoenix_live_session, "~> 0.1"},`
2. Add PhoenixLiveSession as store for Plug.Session:
   ```elixir
    # lib/my_app_web/endpoint.ex
      @session_options [
          store: PhoenixLiveSession,
          pub_sub: MyApp.PubSub,
          signing_salt: "your-salt",
          key: "session"
      ]
   ```

## Usage
### Usage in Phoenix Controllers
  You don’t need to do anything special to use LiveSessions in regular
  Phoenix controllers.
  Your sessions will continue to work the same as with other stores.

### Usage in LiveViews
  Use `maybe_subscribe/2` in your `mount/3` function to subscribe to
  LiveSession updates.
  Only sockets for which `Phoenix.LiveView.connected?/1` returns `true` are
  subscribed by `maybe_subscribe/2`.

  Once you’ve subscribed to a LiveSession, you can handle session
  updates with `handle_info/2` and push session updates with `put_session/3`.

### Usage in LiveComponents
  You can also use LiveSessions without subscribing to them in a LiveView.
  
  In that case, you can directly use the `session` data structure from the
  `mount/3` callback to use `put_session/3`.

### Example
```elixir
defmodule ShoppingCartLive
  use MyAppWeb, :live_view

  def mount(_params, session, socket) do
    socket = socket
    |> PhoenixLiveSession.maybe_subscribe(session)
    |> put_session_assigns(session)

    {:ok, socket}
  end

  def handle_info({:live_session_updated, session}, socket) do
    {:noreply, put_session_assigns(socket, session)}
  end

  def handle_event("add_to_cart", %{"product_id" => product_id}, socket) do
    updated_cart = [product_id | socket.assigns.cart]
    PhoenixLiveSession.put_session(socket, "cart", updated_cart)

    {:noreply, socket}
  end

  defp put_session_assigns(socket, session) do
    socket
    |> assign(:shopping_cart, Map.get(session, "shopping_cart", []))
  end
end
```
